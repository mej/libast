 * Show an object and its contents.

 * lot.  But this standard member function (i.e., all objects must
 * have one) provides the mechanism for which an object can display
 * not only itself and its particular values, but those of any parent
 * class or member object.  Besides the object to be displayed, this
 * function is passed the variable name for that object (usually a
 * constant string, like "foo"), a @c str object, possibly NULL, to be
 * added to and returned, and an indent level, possibly 0, to
 * represent how many leading spaces should pad the resulting output.
 * The @c str object returned is either @a buff, or a new @c str if @a
 * buff was passed as NULL.  Appended to it will be the description of
 * the object followed by a newline.  This description may include
 * descriptions of any number of child variables, parent objects, etc.
 *
 * Implementing this function properly is key to simplifying the
 * examination of objects through the use of debugging code.  I @b
 * highly recommend looking at some examples of how this function
 * should be implemented.
 *
 * The simplest way to display an object is to use the SPIF_SHOW()
 * macro.  This macro takes the object (@a self) and a file descriptor
 * (like @c stderr or #LIBAST_DEBUG_FD), calls the object's @c show
 * method, and prints the resulting string on the given file
 * descriptor, freeing it afterward.  No muss, no fuss.
 *
 * @param self   The @c obj instance.
 * @param name   The name of the variable passed as @a self.
 * @param buff   A @c str object, possibly NULL, used as the buffer.
 * @param indent The number of spaces with which to pad the line.
 * @return       The @c str object, or a new one if @a buff was NULL,
 *               describing @a self.

/**
 * @defgroup DOXGRP_OBJ LibAST Object Infrastructure
 *
 * This group of types, functions, and pre-processor macros implements
 * a mechanism for defining and utilizing objects in native C.
 *
 * C, as you well know, is a procedural language.  It has no native
 * facilities for doing object-oriented programming.  And thusly was
 * born C++ -- native object facilities with much of the same C syntax
 * we all know and love.  But C++ has one very big (and fatal, IMHO)
 * flaw:  it requires a special compiler.
 *
 * That in and of itself is not the end of the world, but it does
 * create a number of issues in terms of portability, standardization,
 * speed, and efficiency.  Since C has been around for so much longer,
 * most C compilers are very stable and reliable, and their
 * optimization routines often do almost as good a job as writing raw
 * assembly code (particularly the vendor compilers).  C++ offers none
 * of these types of advantages, and C++ compiler availability has
 * historically been sketchy at best.
 *
 * There are really 2 possible solutions to this, both accomplishing
 * the same end result (using the native C compiler to manipulate an
 * object model and hierarchy) in two similar, but distinct, ways.
 * Both approaches require the use of some sort of preprocessor.
 * Option #1 would be to use a dedicated preprocessor, either
 * something like m4 or a new creation.  This option would probably
 * allow for cleaner, more native-looking syntax, but it has similar
 * (and potentially worse) portability problems to those of C++.
 *
 * For these reasons, I chose option #2:  a CPP-based (i.e.,
 * macro-based) object model.  As you might imagine, the syntax and
 * usage of such a model bears almost no resemblence whatsoever to
 * that of a native OO language, as it relies heavily on type-casting
 * and namespace safety measures implemented within the existing C/CPP
 * structure.  However, the resultant code is native C, which means
 * you can manipulate data using OO techniques like inheritance,
 * interface classes, etc., without incurring the speed/portability
 * penalties of using the C++ compiler.  Plus, you can build libraries
 * that can be easily linked to both C and C++ programs.
 *
 * If you'd like to see a sample program which demonstrates creation
 * and management of LibAST objects, please look here:
 * @link obj_example.c @endlink.
