/**
 * @defgroup DOXGRP_DEBUG Debugging Subsystem
 *
 * This group of functions/defines/macros implements the debugging
 * subsystem within LibAST.
 *
 * LibAST provides a flexible level-based debugging mechanism to
 * client programs, supporting both compile-time and run-time methods
 * for including or suppressing debugging output by increasing or
 * decreasing the "debug level," i.e. the verbosity, of the system.
 *
 * The current level of debugging output is controlled by the
 * DEBUG_LEVEL variable; to alter it, simply assign a new integer
 * value (from 0 to 9, inclusive) to this variable.
 *
 * LibAST provides debugging for several of its own subsystems and
 * allows client applications to use the same debugging mechanisms by
 * defining its own categories. To use the LibAST debugging system,
 * you will need one #define and one macro for each subsystem or
 * debugging category your program will have.
 *
 * For example, let's say your code contains some socket code.  To
 * create a debugging entity for that code, simply add a #define which
 * sets the debug level for it, and a macro to map output messages to
 * the DPRINTF*() macro for that debug level.  If you wanted
 * socket-related debugging information at debug level 2, you'd use
 * something like these:
 *
 * @code
 * #define DEBUG_SOCKETS  2
 * #define D_SOCKETS(x)   DPRINTF2(x)
 * @endcode
 *
 * That's all there is to it!  Now, anywhere you want socket-related
 * debugging output, just use the D_SOCKETS() macro like so:
 *
 * @code
 *     D_SOCKETS(("Connecting to %s...\n", hostname));
 * @endcode
 *
 * Be sure to use TWO sets of parentheses, not just one.  Don't worry;
 * you'll get used to it! :-)
 *
 * That's all there is to it!
 *
 * If you'd like to see a sample program which uses this system, click
 * @link debug_example.c here @endlink.

/**
 * @example debug_example.c
 * Example code for using the debugging subsystem.
 *
 * This is a trivial code example that uses LibAST-style debugging.
 * The program takes a number, a symbol, and another number on the
 * command line to perform simple arithmetic.  Specify the -d option
 * to enable the debugging output.
 *
 * With debugging output turned off (no -d option), you should see
 * something like this:
 *
 * @code
 * $ ./debug_example 4 + 4
 * 4 + 4 = 8
 * $
 * @endcode
 *
 * With debugging output turned on, you should see something like
 * this:
 *
 * @code
 * $ ./debug_example -d 10 - 14
 * [1045855757] debug_example.c |   35: main(): Debugging is now on.
 * [1045855757] debug_example.c |   48: main(): Number 1 is 10
 * [1045855757] debug_example.c |   43: main(): Got operation '-'.
 * [1045855757] debug_example.c |   51: main(): Number 2 is 14
 * 10 - 14 = -4
 * $
 * @endcode
 *
 * As you can see, the debugging output contains UNIX-style time_t
 * timestamps, source file names, line numbers, and function names for
 * each debugging statement.
 *
 * Here's the complete source code:
