/**
 * Create and open a temporary file.
 *
 * This function creates a temporary file and returns a standard UNIX
 * file descriptor for the new file.  The file is created in $TMPDIR,
 * or $TMP, or /tmp if all else fails.  The libc function @c mkstemp()
 * does the actual file creation/opening.  The umask is set to 0077
 * just before the call, and the permissions are forceably changed to
 * 0600 immediately after.  If the @a len parameter is non-zero, up to
 * @a len characters of the path and filename of the newly-created
 * file are copied into the buffer pointed to by @a ftemplate.  The
 * file descriptor is then returned to the caller.
 *
 * @param ftemplate The initial portion of the filename.  If you want
 *                  the path info returned, make sure this buffer is
 *                  sufficiently large.
 * @param len       The maximum number of bytes @a ftemplate can
 *                  hold.
 * @return          The file descriptor for the new temp file.
