Thu Nov  9 19:09:48 PST 2000	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Added name- and version-setting functions since we can't just use
	PACKAGE and VERSION any more.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Nov  9 19:19:31 PST 2000	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	It usually helps if you finish writing the code BEFORE you commit it.

Thu Nov 16 16:38:55 PST 2000	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Insure++ found a small logic error here that could result in a tiny
	leak under certain circumstances.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jan  2 18:22:25 PST 2001	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Added file.c for any file routines I write.  The first one is a secure
	temp file generator.  If portability issues arise from non-POSIX
	systems, they will be addressed here.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	I have created a testbed for libast.  You can now run "make test" to
	run a series of tests which will test some of the functionality of the
	library.  I didn't finish all the tests I'll eventually have; I just
	wanted to get the stuff that's immediately important.

	I also added a new split() function, which functions somewhat like its
	Perl counterpart, although there are differences.  This function will
	be used in the remaining Eterm work I must do before release.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon May  7 22:16:11 PDT 2001	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Moved chomp() to libast.  It's awfully handy.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue May  8 19:51:51 PDT 2001	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Added two more convenience functions:  join(), also borrowed from
	Perl, and free_array() for freeing lists.  I also threw in a USE_VAR()
	macro for getting rid of bogus unused variable warnings.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed May  9 17:20:46 PDT 2001	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Better handling of NULL values all around.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May 17 10:27:02 PDT 2001	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Fixed "make distcheck."
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jun 11 16:57:40 PDT 2001	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	I moved the config file code from Eterm to libast.  I also relocated
	some of the generic macros (MIN(), MAX(), BOUND(), etc.).  Version up
	to 0.3 now.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jun 15 16:50:54 PDT 2001	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Cleaned up spec file in preparation for release.
