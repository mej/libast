Thu Nov  9 19:09:48 PST 2000	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Added name- and version-setting functions since we can't just use
	PACKAGE and VERSION any more.

	It usually helps if you finish writing the code BEFORE you commit it.

	Insure++ found a small logic error here that could result in a tiny
	leak under certain circumstances.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jan  2 18:22:25 PST 2001	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Added file.c for any file routines I write.  The first one is a secure
	temp file generator.  If portability issues arise from non-POSIX
	systems, they will be addressed here.

	I have created a testbed for libast.  You can now run "make test" to
	run a series of tests which will test some of the functionality of the
	library.  I didn't finish all the tests I'll eventually have; I just
	wanted to get the stuff that's immediately important.

	I also added a new split() function, which functions somewhat like its
	Perl counterpart, although there are differences.  This function will
	be used in the remaining Eterm work I must do before release.

	Moved chomp() to libast.  It's awfully handy.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue May  8 19:51:51 PDT 2001	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Added two more convenience functions:  join(), also borrowed from
	Perl, and free_array() for freeing lists.  I also threw in a USE_VAR()
	macro for getting rid of bogus unused variable warnings.
